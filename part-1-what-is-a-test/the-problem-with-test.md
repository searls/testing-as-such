Now that we have a working definition of what a test is, let's talk about why
it's perhaps an unfortunate choice of word for our industry to have landed on.

other common uses of the English word "test".

TODO
* test as examination
* after-the-fact mindset
* boolean is tested vs not
* concept of variable score
